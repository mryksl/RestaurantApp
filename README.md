# Restaurant App

I just made a simple restaurant web app by using .net core 2.0 framework with razorpages. 

You can order food or add more food into shopping cart then order all at once.. 

And you can manage orders,add new foods to be sold as an Admin by using Admin role..

The project includes: Authorizations, Policies, Sessions, User registirations, Email Verifications, Social Media logins, Admin interface etc..
