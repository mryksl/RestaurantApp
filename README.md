# Restaurant App

I just made a simple restaurant web app by using .net core 2.0 framework with razorpages. 

You can order food or add more food into shopping cart then order all at once and you can manage orders, add new food to be sold as an Admin.

The project includes: Authorizations, Policies, Sessions, User registirations, Admin interface etc..
