# Restaurant App

I just made a simple restaurant web app by using .net core 2.0 framework with razor pages. 

It's a classic food shopping web application.. 

You can manage orders,add new foods to be sold as an Admin by using Admin role..

The project includes: Authorizations, Policies, Sessions, User registirations, Email Verifications, Social Media logins, Admin interface etc..
